## 📋 System Requirements

Before you download, ensure you have the following:

- A system that supports MIPS instructions.
- Basic software to run MIPS binaries (e.g., a MIPS emulator like SPIM or MARS).
- Basic understanding of how to use command line interfaces (optional).

## 💾 Download & Install

To download the application, please visit the following page:

[Download mips-atan2 Releases](https://github.com/manishvedwal2609/mips-atan2/releases)

You will find the latest version of mips-atan2 here. Click on the version you wish to download, which will usually be presented as a zip or tar file. Follow the steps below to install:

1. Click on the desired release version.
2. Scroll down to the "Assets" section.
3. Click on the file to download (e.g., `mips-atan2.zip`).
4. Save the file to a location on your computer where you can easily find it, such as the desktop or a dedicated downloads folder.

## 📂 Extracting Files

Once the download is complete, you need to extract the files. Follow these instructions based on your operating system:

- **Windows:**
  1. Right-click on the downloaded ZIP file.
  2. Select “Extract All…” and follow the prompts.
  
- **Mac:**
  1. Double-click the downloaded ZIP file.
  2. The files will automatically extract to the same location.

- **Linux:**
  1. Open Terminal.
  2. Navigate to the download location using the `cd` command.
  3. Run the command: `unzip mips-atan2.zip`.

## ⚙️ Running the Software

Now that you have the files extracted, you can run the software. Here’s how:

1. Open your MIPS emulator (like SPIM or MARS).
2. Load the extracted mips-atan2 files into the emulator.
3. Follow the emulator's instructions to run the program.

In most cases, you will have to navigate to the directory that contains the mips-atan2 binary file inside your MIPS emulator. This file will typically be named something like `mips-atan2.s` or similar.

## 📖 Using The atan2 Function

The mips-atan2 function allows you to compute the angle whose tangent is the quotient of two specified numbers, which is very useful in various mathematical and engineering applications. Here's a quick guide to understand how to use the function after you've installed it:

- Make sure to pass two numbers (the y-coordinate and then the x-coordinate) to the function.
- The function will return the angle in radians.

For example, if you input `atan2(1, 1)`, you should expect the return value to be `π/4` radians or approximately 0.7854.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure you are using a compatible MIPS emulator.
2. Double-check if all files were extracted correctly.
3. Read the emulator's manual for instructions specific to running MIPS executables.
